## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-02

### Added
- ✨ **Progress Bars**: Real-time visual feedback with document counts during copy operations using `cli-progress`
- 🔄 **Incremental Backups**: Copy only new/updated documents since a specific date using `--incremental`, `--timestamp-field`, and `--since` options
- 🔑 **Index Copying**: Automatically copy indexes from source to target collections with `--copy-indexes` flag
- ✅ **Schema Validation**: Optional pre-copy validation to ensure data compatibility with `--validate-schema` flag
- 🚀 **Performance Optimizations**: Enhanced batch processing with streaming and bulk operations for very large datasets
- 📊 **Progress Control**: Added `--no-progress` flag to disable progress bars when needed
- 🧪 **Enhanced Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite covering all new features, parameter validation, and integration points

### Changed
- 🔧 Improved batch processing with bulkWrite operations for incremental mode
- 🔧 Optimized cursor streaming for better memory efficiency
- 📚 Updated documentation with new CLI examples and API usage patterns
- 📦 Bumped version to 1.1.0 with updated package description

### Technical Details
- Incremental mode uses `replaceOne` with `upsert` for efficient document updates
- Progress bars show collection name, percentage, and document counts
- Index copying filters out `_id_` index and handles conflicts gracefully
- Schema validation performs test insert/delete to verify compatibility
- All new features work seamlessly with JSON export/import modes

## [Unreleased]

### Planned

- Change streams support for real-time sync
- Parallel collection processing
- Compression for JSON exports
